## 📊 Project Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive approach to stock market prediction using:

- **Deep Learning (LSTM)**
- **Traditional Machine Learning models** like Random Forest, Linear Regression, and SVM.

The objective is to compare model performance and identify the most reliable method for forecasting stock prices based on historical data.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

### ✅ 1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Handles sequential dependencies in time-series data.
- Preprocessed data using MinMaxScaler.
- Model trained and tested on historical stock closing prices.
- Visualization included for predicted vs actual performance.

### ✅ 2. Random Forest
- Ensemble learning method using decision trees.
- Capable of capturing nonlinear relationships in data.
- Used here for benchmarking against deep learning.

### ✅ 3. Linear Regression
- Simple and interpretable model.
- Provides a baseline performance estimate.

### ✅ 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Effective in high-dimensional space.
- Tuned for regression analysis using historical data.
