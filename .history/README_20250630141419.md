<p align="center"> <img src="stockmarket.png" alt="Stock Market Prediction" /> </p> <p align="center"> A robust time-series forecasting project leveraging Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques to predict stock market trends. </p>
📊 Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive pipeline for stock market prediction using both deep learning and traditional machine learning models. The project focuses on forecasting the closing price of Infosys (INFY) stock, comparing model performances, and visualizing results.

Key Objectives:

Explore and preprocess historical stock data.

Build, train, and evaluate multiple regression models.

Compare classical ML models with an LSTM deep learning approach.

Forecast future stock prices and visualize predictions.

🗂️ Dataset
Source: Historical daily prices for Infosys (INFY) from 1996 to 2021.

Features Used: Open, High, Low, Close

Target: Next day's closing price (Target column engineered as shifted Close).

🧠 Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression
Simple, interpretable baseline for regression.

Trained on scaled features.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
Captures local patterns in the data.

Used with 4 neighbors.

3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
RBF kernel for non-linear relationships.

Tuned for regression; performance compared with other models.

4. Decision Tree Regression
Handles non-linearity and feature interactions.

Used as a classical ML benchmark.

5. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
Deep learning model designed for sequential/time-series data.

Uses 60-day rolling window as input sequence.

Architecture: Two LSTM layers (64 and 32 units), Dropout for regularization, Dense output.

Trained with early stopping to prevent overfitting.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualization: Trends of Open, High, Low, Close over time.

Correlation Analysis: Heatmap to identify feature redundancy and multicollinearity.

Feature Engineering: Removal of irrelevant columns, creation of Target as next-day close.

🛠️ Data Preprocessing
Train/Test Split: 80/20, preserving temporal order (no shuffling).

Scaling: StandardScaler for ML models; MinMaxScaler for LSTM and Close price normalization.

Sequence Preparation: For LSTM, 60-day rolling window sequences with 4 features.
